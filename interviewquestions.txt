1.Features of REACT:

   A.i.JSX
    ii.Virtual Dom : When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects
    iii.componets.
    iv.one way data binding
     v.High performance


2. Why use React instead of other frameworks, like Angular?
A: Easy creation of dynamic applications,Improves performance,re-usable components,dedicated tools for easy debugging
3.What is the difference between the ES6 and ES5 standards?
A: ES5 :
   var MyComponent= React.createClass({
    render.function(){
        return(
            <h3>HIII</h3>
        )
    }
   })
   ES6: 
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        render(){
            return(
                <h3>Hiii</h3>
            )
        }
    }
4.What is an event in React?
A:  An event is an action that a user or system may trigger, such as pressing a key, a mouse click, etc.
React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase in HTML.
With JSX, you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string in HTML.
 Ex:  class Simple extends React.Component{
    Work(){
        alert("hiii)
    }
    render()
    return(
        <button onClick={this.work}>Button
        </button>
    )

 }
 5. Explain how lists work in React?
 A:  We create lists in React as we do in regular JavaScript. Lists display data in an ordered format
       The traversal of lists is done using the map() function
       const names=["A","B","c","D","E"]
       const listOfName =()=>{
           const listitems =names.m,ap((name)=>
           <li key={name}>
           {name}</li>);
           return(
            <ul>{listitems}</ul>
           )
       }
